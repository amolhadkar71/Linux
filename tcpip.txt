PHYSICAL LAYER:
IT DEFINES HOW TO MOVE BITS FROM ONE DEVICE TO ANOTHER AND ALSO SHOWS HOW THE CABLES, CONNECTORS AND NETWORK INTERFACE CADRS ARE WORKING AND HOW TO SEND RECEIVE BITS.

DATA LINK LAYER:
IT ENCAPSULATES A PACKET IN A FRAME. A FRAME CONTAINS A HEADER AND A TRAILER THAT ENABLE DEVICES TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. A HEADER MOSTLY COMMONLY CONTAINS A SOURCE AND DESTINATION MAC ADDRESS. A TRAILER CONTAINS FRAME CHECK SEQUENCE FILED, WHICH IS USED TO DETECT TRANSMISSION ERRORS.
THE DATA LINK LAYER HAS TWO SUBLAYERS:
1. LOGICAL LINK CONTROL
2. MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL

NETWORK LAYER:
IT DEFINES DEVICE ADDRESSING, ROUTING AND PATH DETERMINATION. LOGICAL ADDRESS IS USED TO IDENTIFY A HOST ON A NETWORK. EG. BY ITS IP ADDRESS

SESSION LAYER:
IT DEFINES HOW TO ESTABLISH AND TERMINATE A SESSION BETWEEN TWO DEVICES.

PRESENTATION LAYER:
IT DEFINES DATA FORMATS.
COMPRESSION, ENCRYPTION N FRAGMENTATION

APPLICATION LAYER:
IT ENABLES NETWORK APPLNS TO COMM WITH OTHER NETWORK APPLS.

Like the OSI model, it describes general guidelines for designing and implementing computer protocols.
